#Semicircular canal system in early primates
#2009
##Mary T Silcox, Jonathan I Bloch, Doug M Boyer, Marc Godinot, Timothy M Ryan, Fred Spoor, Alan Walker
###This paper examined the relationship between semicircular canal radius relative to locomotor agility across mammals. They then used the models generated through looking at these extant data to understand agility in fossil primates and plesiadapiforms. 
####They carried out this study by gathering data. Semicircular canal data came from Spoor et al. 2007 (for exant mammals and primates) and from inner ear endocasts of fossil primates generated through CT data. Body mass data came from Kay and Kirk 2000 (primates and mammals) and generated in this study for fossils. Agility Scores used here were based on Spoor et al 2007. 
####They log 10 transformed agility scores to use as the dependent variable and log 10 transformed body mass and log 10 transformed semicircular canal radii were the independent variables in each regression.
####They used Spoor et al. 2007's phylogenetic tree to run phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares Regressions (pgls) in the REGRESSIONv2.M program in Matlab.
####They ran 4 sets of pgls regressions: 1) the original branch length, 2) transformed branch length using maximum likelihood estimates for the Ornstein-uhlenbeck transform, 3)Grafen's rho, 4)Pagel's lambda. 
####Models were compared using the natural log of the maximum likelihood estimate and the Akaike information criterior.
####regressions were run using a set of 91 primate taxa and using a set of 210 mammalian taxa to determine primate-only vs all-mammal model differences. 
####Using predictive equations generated here, they estimated the agility score in 29 fossil stem/crown primates. 
###They also wanted to estimate body mass in fossils
####They used published predictive equations to estimate body mass in fossil primates preserving an upper 1st or 2nd molar.
####They also gathered data on skull length from Kay and Kirk 2000 to run least squares and Pgls regressions on the relationship between log 10 transformed skull length and log 10 transformed body mass. They did this by dividing taxa into those with more vertical or horizontal positional behaviors and ran independent regressions for each of these groups. They then used these models to estimate body mass in fossil stem/crown primates. 
###They looked at how agility score and each semicircular canal scaled relative to one another
####So they created double log plots of each log10transformed SCC against log10transformed body mass for mammals and primates - incorporating fossil stem/crown primates. They labeled extant taxa by agility category and fossil taxa directly on the plots

##Here:
###I will be carrying out 3 of the sets of pgls regressions run - 1)the original branch length, 2)the transformed branch length using maximum likelihood estimates for Grafen's rho, 3) the maximum likelihood estimates for Pagel's lambda. I attempted to run the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transformation but was not able to produce a usable tree so it was excluded from this exercise. I will pull data from Silcox et al.2009 published either as supplementary data or directly in tables within the text.
###I will then predict agility scores in fossils based regressions using one of these branch transformations for each semicircular canal and the average semicircular canal radius. This will be in comparison to Table 5 within the publication.
###I will then plot extant primates and fossil stem/crown primates for each log10 transformed semicircular canal radius and log10 transformed body mass. Extant taxa will be labelled by agility category.
###They didn't really do any descriptive statistics but for the purpose of this assignment I'm going to use the describeBy() function in the beginning to get some descriptives of the orders within my data initally.

#to carry out Silcox et al 2009's stats I had to pull data from Silcox et al., 2009; Spoor et al. 2007; Kay and kirk, 2000; and Schulz, 1940. 


```{r read tree}
library(ape)
library(curl)
#reading in the tree from Spoor et al. 2007 used in Silcox et al. 2009

Tree<-read.tree(curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilundeen/data_reanalysis_assignment/master/spoor.tre"))
```
##Checking that it looks normal:
```{r}
plot(as.phylo(Tree), cex=0.5) 
```

##Checking that it looks **FUN**:
```{r}

plot(as.phylo(Tree), type="fan",cex=0.8, label.offset=0.2, edge.color=c("red","orange","yellow","green","forestgreen","aquamarine","deepskyblue","dodgerblue3","royalblue2","slateblue4","purple3","magenta4","maroon"), tip.color=c("red","orange","yellow","green","forestgreen","aquamarine","deepskyblue","dodgerblue3","royalblue2","slateblue4","purple3","magenta4","maroon"))


```

#now that the tree is read in correctly, it's time to read in the data from Silcox et al 2009 used to produce pgls regressions

```{r read data}
data<-read.csv(curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilundeen/data_reanalysis_assignment/master/silcox2009data.csv"), header=TRUE) 
```

#reading in the data that I used here
#this data set was downloaded as a supplementary file
```{r make tree and data comparable}
head(data) #checking to see if that data looks fine

library(psych) #psych package contains the describeBy function
describeBy(data,group=data$Order,mat=FALSE) #get descriptive statistics by Order of my dataset
detach("package:psych",unload=TRUE)
library(methods) #this is here because my computer kept giving me an error and this seemed to solve it. 
```
###There's a lot of NA because many of the predictions are specifically for primates - none of which are visible when looking at the first 6 species in the data set
```{r}

#little function to underline the taxa in my data to make it comparable to the taxa in the tree

  require(stringr)
  taxon_vector <- str_replace(string= taxon_vector, pattern=" ", replacement="_")
  return(taxon_vector)
}

#check for overlap between taxa in the tree and taxa in my data
row.names(data)<-data$Species #assigning species in my data as the comparable group to my tree
#checking for overlap in data

str(overlap) #check what is actually within that overlap value
overlap$data_not_tree #identify the specific taxa that are in the data but not located in the tree
overlap$tree_not_data #identify the species that are in the tree but not in the data

#this shows that there are a few species in my data that are slightly off in their formatting - so now I'll individually go through and rename them in my data set so that they'll match up with data in the Spoor et al.2007 tree that Silcox et al. 2009 used.

#now rechecking the names to make sure the names are formatted correctly. 
row.names(data)<-data$Species #assigning my species to my row names
name.check(Tree,data)->overlap #creates an overlap value
str(overlap) #list the species within overlap
#the only species that is not in the Silcox data set but IS in the spoor tree is the Tamandua so this line of code drops that from the tree
drop.tip(Tree, overlap$tree_not_data) -> my_tree
#now plot the tamandua-less tree.

###Clearly these intercepts are not very close to those published in Silcox et al. 2009....This suggests either that I ran these regressions incorrectly or they transformed the branch length in the regressions that they ultimately used. 

##Next I will demonstrate why I didn't feel my Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transformation was useful....

##Side Note interpretation of these results - 
### agility score increases with speed (1=slow=loris and 6=fast=Galago)
### these agiliity scores - which are actually quite close to those predicted in Table 5 of Silcox et al 2009 - indicate that there was a variety of speeds in plesiadapiforms and euprimates. Omomyoid primates had the highest agility scores predicted here indicating that they moved faster than other fossil taxa here.

###My plots are showing the same data as those shown in Silcox et al because I wasn't predicting body mass here
